# What is this?

[Go down to the Projects section](#projects)

I have been coding since I was 15. I've started with Visual Basic and then dove into web. Since then I've been consuming all sorts of knowledge on programming, algorithms, and computers in general.

I'm a physicist, but I have worked as web developer, web designer, graphic designer, social media guru, etc. Besides all of those, I am using computation and automation in my own work all the time. I simulate integrated optical devices, I automate experimental setups, I collect data, I analyse data, I visualise data, and so on...

However I am also very interested in other sorts of data. So I've been fiddling around with web scraping and I've been working on visualizing the data I've collected. So here, I am presenting the results of those works, both the codes and the data.

Since these are very small projects, I intend to list them on one page (with explanations.) However, if a project becomes more involved, then it'll have it's own page.
