# Projects

I like learning by doing. Most of my personal projects are listed on [my github](https://github.com/ekarademir?tab=repositories).

Some of those projects can be run on browsers so they have their own demo pages.

* [Kaleidopaint](https://www.ekarademir.com/kaleidopaint-proto/)
* [A Tetris clone](https://www.ekarademir.com/tetr/)
* [A Minesweeper clone](https://www.ekarademir.com/mines/)
* [A very bad Arkanoid clone](https://www.ekarademir.com/bounce/)
