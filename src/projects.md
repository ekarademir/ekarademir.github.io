# Projects

I like learning by doing. Most of my personal projects are listed on [my github](https://github.com/ekarademir?tab=repositories).

Some of those projects can be run on browsers so they have their own demo pages.

# Serious-ish Projects
## pymongo-inmemory
[[source](https://github.com/kaizendorks/pymongo_inmemory)]
* A testing library for Pymongo, that spins up an ephemeral Mongo server in memory.
* Still in early alpha but tested on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Thorlabs-Kinesis
[[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/thorlabs-kinesis)]
* A very basic wrapper for Thorlabs Kinesis library in Python.
* I developed this to use at Eblana Photonics for an in-house project.
* Unfortunatelly it's not complete, because I simply did not have all the motorized stages implemented in the source library. So it's not a complete PyPI package. It's still usable though.

# Experiments PoCs

## Kaleidopaint
[[demo](https://www.ekarademir.com/kaleidopaint-proto/)][[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/kaleidopaint-proto)]
* Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) as the main interaction library.
* All cursor interactions are done using SVG animations.

## Tetris clone in JavaScript
[[demo](https://www.ekarademir.com/tetr/)][[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/tetr)]
* Implemented completely in vanilla JS

## Tetris clone in C
[[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/TetrSDL)]
* A similar clone to above implementation but using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) library with C.
* Worked with [SDL TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) for drawing text on screen.

## A Minesweeper clone
[[demo](https://www.ekarademir.com/mines/)][[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/mines)]
* Vanilla JS implementation
* Self challenge for re-learning JS

## A very bad Arkanoid clone
[[demo](https://www.ekarademir.com/bounce/)][[source](https://github.com/ekarademir/bounce)]
* Another experiment with event capture, user interaction, and responsivity.
* Implemented in vanilla JS
