## Hi, my name is Ertugrul
I am a Dublin based software engineer with passion of building robust and secure software systems.
I've built data analysis pipelines and I've worked on retail, banking, inventory, and quality
assurance projects. My current responsibility is to develop cloud infrastructure for continuous
delivery and integration.

My strongest suite is **Python** and **Java-Script**, but I love **Rust**. I can analyse data with
**pandas** and I can do scientific computation with **numpy** and **scipy**. I can build services
with **ExpressJS** and the front-end that uses it via **VueJS**. I can also build
cloud-infrastructure with **Terraform**, **Helm**, and **Kubernetes**. I've used a lof of other
similar technologies. Hava a look at [my CV](/cv) to see all.

I work as a senior software engineer at Oliver Wyman Digital and I co-organise [Rust Dublin
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Dublin/)

I do open-source. Have a look at my [open-source projects](/projects) or all my [GitHub
projects](https://github.com/ekarademir).
