## Hi, my name is Ertugrul
<big>I am a Dublin based software engineer with passion of building robust and secure software
systems.</big>

I've worked on retail, banking, inventory, and quality assurance projects. My current responsibility
is to develop cloud infrastructure for continuous delivery and integration but I've built data
analysis pipelines, micro-services, standard data layers, and desktop applications. Hava a look at [my CV](/cv) to
see what I did.

I work as a senior software engineer at Oliver Wyman Digital and I co-organise [Rust Dublin
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Dublin/)

I do open-source. Have a look at my [open-source projects](/projects) or all my [GitHub
projects](https://github.com/ekarademir).
